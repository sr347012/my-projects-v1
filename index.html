                        <p>eZY Money is an application where any customer can request for a nominal amount of Rs 5000/- and be credited within 60 minutes, if eligible.Now-a-days there are many apps(especially from China) in the market targeting the users for lending money in short duration. People fall for their traps in lieu of getting the money not foreseeing the consequences. At a later point in time, if they are not paying the amount, their contacts will be in the spotlight spreading the financial state of the payee. In turn, it causes disrespect and in some cases, it leads to suicides as well. The cybercrime police department has warned people not to fall for such apps. This idea aims to target such customers, where Banks can lend the money and recover in a short duration.</p>

                        <p>When customers go to a traditional supermarket with the intention of buying a certain list of things, They may be tempted to buy other items, as they generate thoughts. Finally, they end up in purchasing more than what they intended to buy. This is how the traditional supermarkets attract the customers
                            We propose a similar solution where a customer is guided through a certain ‘recommended’ products along with his order, in order to provide him with the best experience.                        
                            This a browser based machine learning approach where the orders are passed through a set of javascript libraries to process the data, prepare and train the model, and provide recommendations based on each order.
